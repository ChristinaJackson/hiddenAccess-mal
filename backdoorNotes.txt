Backdoors

Most cases ult goal is to control target system and execute commands + see results
Gives us access to the system:
    Command execution, access file system, upload/download/keylogger, cameras, microphones etc
There are already programs - this is for learning and understanding

Backdoors have to be interactive
    Connection needs to be established - one way to connect is by using sockets

 Sockets:
    Establishes connections and passes data


Bind/Direct connections
    initial connection from attacker to victim needs to be listening on a certain port
    Not great because if the victim has firewall etc it will likely give a warning if an unknown port has been opening

Reverse connection
    When backdoor executed it will connect back to the attacker-
    Attacker opens their own port and listen for incoming connections
    Execute backdoor on victim, and that will connect victim -> attacker
    Most firewalls will not trigger this as suspicious, especially if attacker is using commonly known ports
